# Boreal Package Generator

## Introduction

The Boreal Package Generator allows you to quickly create projects with different configurations. By running a few commands, you can set up a project with Electron.js and Next.js, create a new package, or develop a new CLI.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Run the Initial Command

To get started, run the following command:

```bash
npx create-boreal-package
```

or


```bash
npm create boreal-package
```


### Step 2: Choose an Option

After running the initial command, you will see three options:

a) **Electron.js with Next.js**
b) **Make a new package**
c) **Make a new CLI**

### Step 3: Select an Option

#### Option (a): Electron.js with Next.js

If you select this option, the generator will create a project with Electron.js, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS. This setup allows you to build software for Windows, macOS, and Linux easily.

#### Option (b): Make a New Package

Selecting this option will give you a directory with TypeScript, Rollup.js, and example code. This setup is a complete bundle for creating custom packages.

#### Option (c): Make a New CLI

Choosing this option will provide you with a complete bundle for developing a new Command Line Interface (CLI).

### Step 4: Install Dependencies

After selecting one of the options and the project is generated, navigate to the project folder and install the dependencies:

```bash
cd your-project-folder
npm install
```

Your project is now set up and ready for development!
